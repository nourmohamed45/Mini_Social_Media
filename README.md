This mini social media web application, tightly integrated with a powerful backend API, offers users a dynamic platform to connect and share. Users can seamlessly perform actions such as user registration, login, and logout. Additionally, they can create, edit, and delete posts, view detailed post information, and engage with the community by adding comments or exploring comments from other users. Users can also browse and view profile details of other members. my primary focus was on the logical aspects of the web application, which I managed using pure JavaScript.
